        <h1 class="article-title">I Read Every AI + PMM Story for a Month. Here's What's Actually Coming.</h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">After 35 editions and 180 articles, the pattern is unmistakable—and a little unsettling.</p>
    </header>

    <article class="article-body">
        <p>A few weeks ago we launched this thing on The Future of PMM called the Daily Digest—basically an automated scan of everything being published at the intersection of AI and product marketing, surfaced every morning, five or six stories at a time. It was supposed to be a convenience feature, something people could glance at over coffee so they didn't have to maintain twelve RSS feeds and a TweetDeck column. I figured I'd learn a few things from it, but mostly I already live in this world—I read the analyst reports, I sit through the vendor briefings, I know what's happening.</p>

        <p>Except I didn't, quite. Because what I discovered after about a month of these things stacking up is that there's a difference between reading the news and watching the news accumulate. Any single story—a Gartner forecast here, a vendor announcement there—tells you something narrow and forgettable. But 35 editions and maybe 180 individual articles later, read all at once, the pattern is unmistakable and honestly a little unsettling.</p>

        <p>Now, I should be upfront about something. I did not spend a long weekend with a highlighter and a legal pad going through all of this. I opened Claude, pointed it at a month's worth of Daily Digest URLs, and asked it to pull out the recurring themes and data points across every story we'd published since late January. The whole read-and-synthesize process took maybe four minutes. I'm telling you this because the entire point of this site is that AI changes how product marketers work, and it would be slightly absurd to write an article about that transformation while pretending I'd done the analysis by hand. The trends and the argument are mine. The reading-at-scale part is the machine doing what machines do best—and honestly, it's a pretty good demonstration of the very thing I'm about to describe.</p>

        <p>So here's what we found.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Buyer Might Not Be a Person Anymore</h2>

        <p>The story that kept showing up—in different forms, from different sources, almost every single day—is that <strong>the buyer is changing faster than the people who sell to them</strong>. And I don't mean changing their preferences or their buying committee structure or whatever else you'd normally mean by that phrase. I mean the buyer might not be a person anymore.</p>

        <p>Jensen Huang got on NVIDIA's earnings call in late February and told Wall Street that agentic AI had hit an "inflection point," which is a very specific thing for a CEO to say to analysts—it means the revenue is real, the trajectory is accelerating, and this is not a pilot-phase conversation. NVIDIA did $216 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, up 65% year over year, and Huang attributed the growth to enterprise demand for agentic AI infrastructure. He described a kind of global "awakening" to what agents could do and said it had happened in the last two or three months, which—not for nothing—is roughly the same window we've been running the digest.</p>

        <p>Around the same time, G2 published a report showing that nearly 60% of enterprises now have AI agents in production. Not piloting, not evaluating, not trapped in some innovation sandbox where a VP of Digital Transformation gets to play with a chatbot and present the results at an offsite. <em>In production.</em> And Search Engine Land ran a major piece declaring that GEO—Generative Engine Optimization—is the new SEO, which sounds like another acronym we don't need until you think about what it actually means: the primary discovery channel for your product is shifting from a search bar to a prompt window, and the thing on the other side of that window doesn't think the way a human researcher does.</p>

        <p>I spent fifteen years selling to procurement committees and CIOs and CMOs, and the thing about that job is that half of it was reading the room. You'd figure out who was skeptical, who needed the ROI slide first, who was going to be your champion, who just wanted to get through the meeting so they could deal with the twelve other things on their plate that week. You'd adjust the story on the fly—lean into the competitive angle with one audience, lead with the integration story for another, find the thing that made the technical capability connect to whatever business problem kept the decision-maker up at night. It's a deeply human skill, and it's the thing most PMMs are genuinely good at.</p>

        <p>But when an AI agent is doing the initial research—and increasingly, it is—none of that matters. The agent pulls your G2 reviews, your analyst mentions, your feature comparison page, your pricing, and synthesizes all of it against three or four competitors before your SDR has finished writing the outreach email. It doesn't care about your brand narrative or your clever tagline or your emotional positioning about empowering teams to unlock their potential. <strong>It wants structured claims, factual evidence, and data it can parse.</strong> That's the whole list.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <h4>💡 Try This Today</h4>
            <p>Ask Claude or ChatGPT the buying questions your customers ask about your product. "What's the best solution for X?" "How does Y compare to Z?" Look hard at what comes back. If your product doesn't show up, or shows up with wrong information, that's the fire to put out first.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>Thought Leadership Is Dead. Long Live Receipts.</h2>

        <p>The second thread running through the digest is something I've been turning over for a while, but the data finally caught up to the hunch: <strong>thought leadership, as a positioning strategy, is basically dead</strong>.</p>

        <p>I know how that sounds coming from a guy who writes a newsletter called The Future of PMM—but hear me out. I've been around long enough to remember when the playbook worked beautifully. You wrote the smart column—I did this for years at AdExchanger, and it was fun as hell—you got invited to the panels, the halo transferred to the product, the CMO could point to a stack of press clippings at a board meeting and say "we own the conversation on this topic." And for a while, owning the conversation actually translated into pipeline, because the buyers were reading the same stuff and making a connection between the quality of your thinking and the quality of your product.</p>

        <p>What the digest showed me, week after week, is that the market has moved to a <strong>receipts-based model</strong>. Salesforce reported actual agentic AI revenue—not "pipeline" or "early signals" or "strong interest from strategic accounts," but revenue, from customers paying for agent capabilities. Salsify announced 768 million automated tasks. Jasper didn't just talk about agents, they shipped an agent platform. And BCG's AI Disruption Index showed up in our feed almost every single week with more data on which companies are separating from the pack and which ones are still running pilots and talking about transformation on LinkedIn.</p>

        <p>The flip side showed up too—multiple stories about what the digest sources kept calling the "AI tax" on renewals, where vendors who can't demonstrate the value of their AI investments are getting punished at renewal time. Customers aren't renewing on faith anymore. They want to see the math, and if the math isn't there, they're looking at competitors who can show it.</p>

        <p class="pullquote">"The PMM who can build an ROI case from real product telemetry is about to become the most important hire on the marketing team."</p>

        <p>This changes the PMM job in a way that I think a lot of people in our function haven't fully grasped yet. We've always been the storytelling layer—you take what engineering builds and you make it resonate with the market, you connect capability to outcome, you give sales something they can walk into a room and feel confident about. That's real, valuable, and it's not going away entirely. But when the buyer's agent—or increasingly, the buyer themselves armed with much better tools—is comparing your actual usage metrics against three competitors in real time, the narrative takes a backseat to the numbers. The PMM who can build an ROI case from real product telemetry—consumption data, adoption curves, time-to-value benchmarks—and pipe that into every analyst interaction, every competitive card, every piece of content the company produces? That person is about to become the most important hire on the marketing team. The PMM who only knows how to write a good positioning doc is in a tougher spot, and I say that as someone who has spent most of his career writing positioning docs.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Number I Can't Stop Thinking About</h2>

        <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="number">6%</div>
            <p>The share of marketers who have fully implemented AI in their workflows, according to Supermetrics' 2026 Marketing Data Report.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And the details underneath that number are even worse—more than half of marketing teams said that external teams define their data strategy, fifty percent wait one to three business days for data support, and a grand total of seven percent get anything resembling real-time access to their own data.</p>

        <p>Now, hold that in your head while I tell you what else was in the digest during the same period. WPP and Adobe announced a partnership to build AI-native marketing workflows. CMOs were being described in one piece as "agentic with a small a"—meaning they know it's coming, they talk about it at offsites, they've probably sat through a McKinsey presentation about it, but the org isn't actually wired for it yet. BCG's disruption index kept showing up, week after week, tracking a gap between AI-native organizations and everyone else that is not closing.</p>

        <p>I see this divergence up close at SAP, and I hear about it in every conversation I have across the industry. The teams that built their AI stacks early—competitive monitoring agents, RAG-powered knowledge bases, automated content workflows—aren't operating ten percent faster than everyone else. They're doing things that were literally not possible eighteen months ago. Real-time competitive intelligence pulled from hundreds of sources simultaneously. Battlecards that update themselves when a competitor changes their pricing page. Market signal detection that would have taken a full-time analyst a solid month, generated before your morning standup.</p>

        <p>And then there are the teams filing a ticket and waiting three business days for a data pull. Both of these realities exist right now, in the same industry, sometimes in the same company. <strong>That's not a gap that's going to close gradually. It's a step function—you're on one side or the other, and every month the distance between the two sides gets wider.</strong></p>

        <h2>Three Things I'd Be Thinking About</h2>

        <p>Look, I'm not going to give you a numbered list of action items. You're a grown-up, you know your own situation, and the specifics of what you need to do depend on about fifty variables I don't have access to. But I will tell you the three things I'd be thinking about if I were a PMM reading this in March of 2026 and starting to feel the ground shift under me.</p>

        <p><strong>First, I'd go interrogate an LLM about my own product.</strong> Today, not next sprint. I'd ask it the buying questions my customers ask—"what's the best solution for X," "how does Y compare to Z," "who's the leader in this space"—and I'd look hard at what comes back. If my product doesn't show up, or if it shows up with wrong or outdated information, that's the fire to put out first, because it means I'm already invisible in what might be the fastest-growing discovery channel in B2B.</p>

        <p><strong>Second, I'd take a serious look at whether I'm the messaging person or the proof person on my team</strong>—because the job is moving toward proof at a speed that surprised even me when I saw the digest data. If your company tracks consumption metrics, adoption curves, time-to-value—and if you're not already turning that data into competitive ammunition that flows through every channel—somebody else will.</p>

        <p><strong>And third, I'd build my own AI toolkit. This quarter.</strong> Not because it makes a great LinkedIn post about being an "AI-forward PMM" or whatever, but because the six percent number is a window that's closing. This article is a small example of what I mean—I didn't spend a weekend reading 180 stories with a highlighter. I had an AI read them, I pushed on the output, I shaped the argument, and the whole thing came together in an afternoon. That's not cheating. That's the job now.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>The digest keeps running every morning. Some days the lead story is a major analyst report that reframes how I think about a market. Some days it's a weird little vendor announcement that tells you more about where things are heading than any strategy deck I've read in the last year. I didn't expect the accumulation to be the insight—I thought it would just be a news feed—but it turns out that watching 180 stories pile up in a month paints a picture you can't see from any individual article, and it's a picture that's pretty hard to look away from.</p>
