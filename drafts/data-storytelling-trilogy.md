# The Stories That Shaped Three Books: Data, Customers, and the Agentic Future

*Lessons from a decade of marketing transformation—told through the people and companies who lived it.*

---

When I started writing *Data Driven* in 2017, I had one question: how do you convince a room full of marketers that data isn't just a technical problem—it's *the* competitive advantage of the next decade?

The answer wasn't charts. It wasn't architecture diagrams. It was stories.

Over three books and nearly a decade, I've collected stories from CMOs, CDOs, data scientists, and practitioners who were building the future of marketing in real-time. Some succeeded brilliantly. Some failed instructively. All of them taught me something about how data transforms organizations—and how organizations resist that transformation.

Here are the stories that stuck with me.

## The $5 Chip That Changed Everything

In 2015, I sat across from Mike Cunningham, then Chief Digital Officer at Keurig Green Mountain. Mike had an idea that seemed equal parts brilliant and insane.

"I want to put a $5 data collection chip in our coffee makers," he said. "Can you tell me what it's worth?"

His vision: an optical scanner to identify K-Cups, a Bluetooth beacon to detect nearby mobile devices, and an LCD screen for targeted messages. Every cup of coffee would generate a data signal. Keurig would finally *know* its customers—not just the retailers who bought pallets of K-Cups, but the actual humans drinking the coffee.

We built the business case. The math worked. The insight potential was enormous. You could understand household consumption patterns, predict replenishment timing, identify flavor preferences. You could move from "Walmart ordered 50,000 K-Cups" to "Dad drinks dark roast Sumatra at 6am, Mom prefers French Hazelnut at 7:30, and their 12-year-old sneaks Donut Shop K-Cups on weekends when no one's watching."

That was 2015. Keurig ultimately decided not to put a DMP in their coffee makers.

But in 2026, I'd give Mike completely different advice.

"You don't need the chip," I'd tell him. "The customer's agent already knows all of that. The agent is monitoring Dad's morning routine, tracking consumption patterns, querying multiple retailers simultaneously for pricing and availability. It knows when you're running low before any LCD screen could tell you."

The question isn't "what's the value of a $5 chip that helps you discover the customer?" It's "what's the value of being the brand the customer's agent chooses by default?"

Mike's vision was ahead of its time. But the world moved even faster than he imagined—in a direction none of us predicted.

## The Pizza That Proved the Point

Sometimes the most powerful data stories are the simplest ones.

Casey's General Stores—a Midwest convenience chain—partnered with an agency called Boom Boom Jones on something deceptively straightforward. They wanted to send personalized emails to customers who hadn't ordered pizza recently.

The innovation? Put a picture of *the customer's usual order* in the email.

Not a generic pizza stock photo. Not a coupon. A photo of *their* pizza—pepperoni and mushroom, the one they ordered every Friday night for six months until they stopped.

The result: **300% lift in conversion.**

Not 30%. Not 3%. Three hundred percent.

No AI. No billion-dollar infrastructure. No three-year transformation program. Just connecting the email system to the point-of-sale data and showing customers what they already loved.

I've told this story a hundred times because it cuts through every objection. "We don't have the budget." "Our systems are too complex." "We need to wait for the technology to mature." Casey's didn't wait. They connected two databases and tripled their conversion rate.

But here's the part I didn't understand until I started writing *The Agentic Customer*: that personalized pizza picture was optimized for human psychology. The nostalgic pull of seeing your usual order. The visual appeal. The implicit message: *we remember you*.

An AI agent doesn't feel nostalgia. It doesn't respond to appetizing photography. It needs structured data: Is the pizza available? What's the price? What's the delivery estimate? Does this outlet accept the preferred payment method?

The 300% lift was real—for humans. The future belongs to brands that can win over both the human *and* the agent. And they're playing completely different games.

## The Toilet Paper Company's Existential Question

In *Data Driven*, I told the story of Georgia-Pacific—the paper products company behind Brawny, Dixie, and Vanity Fair. Their CMO, Douwe Bergsma, walked into our meeting and posed a question that stopped me cold:

"Kate Metzinger, our media leader, believes we need a data management platform. You may be wondering why a company that sells toilet paper, paper towels, and napkins needs such a technology. We thought perhaps you could tell us."

It was a perfect encapsulation of the data scarcity mindset. Georgia-Pacific didn't have CRM records for the millions of people buying Brawny paper towels at Walmart. Their first-party data was limited to the small number of consumers who visited Dixie's website or signed up for coupons. Like Kellogg's and Hershey's and every other CPG company selling through retail intermediaries, Georgia-Pacific was at arm's length from the end customer.

The solution we helped build was a DMP strategy that harvested data signals from digital advertising—every click, video view, and social interaction with anonymous consumers—and assembled them into behavioral profiles that could inform targeting and measurement. It was Principle #2 from *Data Driven* in action: you have more data than you think. Georgia-Pacific didn't have CRM records, but it had millions of dollars in addressable media spending generating valuable signals.

Now imagine Georgia-Pacific facing the agentic era.

The challenge isn't data scarcity anymore—it's structural invisibility. An agent managing household replenishment for a family doesn't browse the Brawny website. It doesn't see Georgia-Pacific's "Take Back the Table" campaign on Pinterest. It doesn't engage with the Vanity Fair napkins content on AllRecipes.com.

The agent needs to know: what paper towels does Georgia-Pacific offer? What are the sizes, the counts, the absorbency ratings? What's the price per sheet? Is it available for delivery? What's the delivery timeline? How does the absorbency compare to Bounty? Is the packaging recyclable?

If that information exists only on a product page designed for humans—embedded in marketing copy, buried in accordion menus, formatted for visual appeal rather than structured data extraction—the agent either can't access it or has to work much harder to parse it.

Georgia-Pacific's *Data Driven*-era challenge was: "How do we capture data about our customers when we sell through intermediaries?"

Their agentic-era challenge is: "How do we make our products machine-readable when the customer's agent is doing the shopping?"

The first challenge was about knowing the customer. The second is about being known by the customer's agent.

## Delta's Porsche on the Tarmac

When I think about what connected customer data actually *feels* like from the customer's perspective, I think about Delta.

A few years ago, before the pandemic, my family was about to miss a connection between Atlanta and St. Thomas—putting the entire vacation at risk. Even though the trip was purchased with loyalty points, I tweeted to @Delta and explained our situation: very late arrival, worried we'd miss our connection (a very long walk and train ride between gates).

What happened next defines what "customer data" really means in practice.

Delta met us at the gate. They took us down the stairs to the tarmac. And they whisked us from Concourse A to Concourse F in a Porsche Macan, saving our entire vacation.

What was that small gesture worth? I may never book another airline again.

Delta runs on experience. Whether you're a Silver Medallion loyalty customer or a "Delta 360" super elite flyer, Delta's goal is to make your loyalty count through better and more personalized experiences. In order to make that equation work, Delta has to be extremely close to its loyal customers, and make sure each touchpoint—website, social, mobile app, call center, and ecommerce—are perfectly aligned and operate in as close to real-time as possible.

This is what *Customer Driven* was really about. Not the technology. Not the data. The *experience* that unified data makes possible.

## The Company That Did Everything Right

This one haunts me.

I call them Apex Home Goods—a composite, but the story is real. Over eight years, Apex built the data-driven marketing infrastructure that both my previous books prescribed. DMP for audience management. CDP for customer unification. Journey orchestration across twelve channels. Real-time personalization. ML-powered segmentation. A Center of Excellence with dedicated headcount. Executive sponsorship. Governance frameworks.

They reached Level 4 maturity on every assessment we ran. Eight figures invested. And it worked—for a while. Open rates climbed. Customer lifetime value increased. Attribution became measurable. The CMO presented at conferences. The team won awards.

Then something shifted.

In late 2025, the metrics started plateauing. Email open rates stopped growing. Organic search traffic declined slightly. Nothing catastrophic—just a persistent flatness where there used to be momentum.

The deeper we dug, the stranger it got. Their most valuable customers hadn't left. They were still buying—actually buying *more* than before. But their behavior had changed. Orders were more precise. Less browsing. Fewer page views. The journey had collapsed into something that looked less like exploration and more like procurement.

We finally understood when the VP of E-commerce pulled up the session recordings. Customers weren't navigating the site anymore. They were arriving at exactly the right product page, adding to cart, and checking out. No meandering. No recommendations. No upsells.

The customers had delegated.

Their AI agents were doing the research, comparison, evaluation, and even negotiation. By the time the human clicked "buy," the decision was already made. Apex's beautiful, personalized, emotionally resonant customer experience? The agent couldn't see it. Didn't care about it. Couldn't process it.

The agent needed structured product data, real-time inventory feeds, competitive pricing, and a reliable API.

Apex had a gorgeous website.

They're rebuilding now. The lesson is expensive: doing everything right for the *last* paradigm doesn't protect you from the next one.

## Heineken's Inverted Bullseye

In the early days of DMPs, I met with Ronald den Elzen, the CEO of Heineken USA. He drew a bullseye on the whiteboard that's stayed with me ever since.

The outer ring: 320 million Americans.
Next ring: 140 million of legal drinking age.
Next: 90 million who drink alcohol.
Next: 60 million who drink beer.
The center: 18-20 million who are Heineken lovers.

"Can you help me find these people?" Ronald asked.

That question—and the bullseye diagram—defined an entire era of data-driven marketing. The brand started with the total addressable market and progressively filtered down to the ideal customer. The DMP was the engine that made that filtering possible at scale, finding those 18 million Heineken lovers across the fragmented digital landscape.

But the agentic era inverts the bullseye completely.

Now imagine a customer's agent broadcasting from the center *out*: "My principal is a 38-year-old male, drinks premium imported lager, prefers bottles, $15/six-pack budget, values sustainability."

The agent isn't waiting to be found. It's announcing preferences and inviting brands to compete for consideration. Ronald's question becomes "Can you help me *be found* by their agents?"

The answer isn't segmentation. It's structured product data, real-time availability, competitive pricing, and verifiable sustainability credentials that the agent can evaluate.

The bullseye didn't change. Who's holding the marker did.

## Joe the Car Shopper, Then and Now

When I was writing *Customer Driven*, we mapped an actual customer journey for a car purchase. I called him Joe.

**Joe's 2018 journey** started with a cable TV ad during a football game. Then a Facebook like. Then a tablet browse at 11pm. Then a desktop research session the next morning. Then a credit application on his phone during lunch. Then a dealership visit where beacons tracked his path through the showroom. Then a second dealership. Then an email signup. Then a video ad that followed him for weeks. Then, finally, a purchase.

Dozens of touchpoints. Hundreds of data signals. A dozen different systems—none of which talked to each other.

The punchline of that story was devastating: **nobody ever saw this summary.** Not the dealers. Not the manufacturer. Not the ad platforms. Each system had its fragment, but no system had the customer.

And for two years after Joe drove his new car home, he kept getting served ads for the exact car he'd already purchased. The ecosystem had enough data to be annoying but not enough integration to be useful.

That was the problem *Customer Driven* tried to solve. The CDP was supposed to unify those fragments into a coherent customer record.

We solved that problem. Then the world changed again.

**Joe's 2026 journey** looks nothing like his 2018 journey.

His AI agent absorbed his requirements through conversation: three-row SUV, hybrid, under $55,000, good safety ratings. The agent queried twelve manufacturers in seconds. Evaluated powertrain specs, crash test results, warranty terms, total cost of ownership. Narrowed to seven candidates, then two finalists. Negotiated with multiple dealers simultaneously. Handled financing pre-approval and trade-in valuation.

Joe walked into one dealership on Saturday. Already approved. Price already set. Trade-in already agreed. He signed the paperwork and drove home.

Time elapsed: about a week, mostly Joe's own deliberation. The agent's work took hours.

The 2018 journey was chaos. The 2026 journey is choreographed by an AI that's better at car shopping than Joe ever was—and infinitely better than the marketing systems trying to influence him.

## The Priest Who Understood It First

My favorite story isn't from a Fortune 500 CMO. It's from a priest.

In 1961—years before the term "database marketing" existed—a Catholic charity was struggling with fundraising efficiency. They had thousands of donors, handwritten records, and no way to understand who was likely to give again.

Father Schmitt proposed a radical solution: computerize the donor records.

They rented time on an IBM 650 mainframe. They encoded each donor onto magnetic tape—341 characters per record. Address. Donation history. Relationship information. Giving patterns.

Then they did something remarkable: they used the data to personalize their outreach. Donors who gave to education causes got education appeals. Donors who gave during Lent got Lenten campaigns. Donors who'd lapsed got re-engagement letters.

**Their response rate: 80%.**

Not 8%. Eighty percent.

In 1961. With magnetic tape. With 341 characters of data.

I love this story because it proves that the principles are timeless. The technology changes—vacuum tubes to transistors to cloud computing to AI agents—but the logic remains identical. Collect data about people. Store it coherently. Process it for insight. Activate it for engagement. Measure what works.

Father Schmitt would understand the agentic era instantly. The data input is different (agent queries instead of donation envelopes). The storage is different (cloud infrastructure instead of magnetic tape). The processing is different (real-time ML instead of batch mainframe runs). But the six-step cycle? Identical.

Father Schmitt's IBM 650 processed dozens of records per hour.

An AI agent evaluates dozens of brands per second.

Six orders of magnitude. The logic didn't change at all.

## Campbell's Seventy-Year Head Start

Here's a story that spans my entire career—and then some.

Campbell's Soup Company has been using weather data to direct its marketing budgets since the 1950s. People buy more soup when a storm is coming. Campbell's pioneered the idea of leveraging local weather data to target advertising, starting with radio spots and evolving through television, digital, and now addressable channels.

By the time we worked with them at Krux, they had turned this into a science: combining their DMP, third-party weather data, and location-based targeting to generate demand in stores that had the highest propensity to sell soup. Cold snap coming to Chicago? Surge the digital spend there. Warm front moving through Phoenix? Pull back.

But in *The Agentic Customer*, I write about taking this even further. What if you went beyond weather targeting and added enterprise-grade insights? Stores with high inventory availability. Promotional calendar alignment. Category-specific seasonality patterns.

And then the ultimate question: what happens when the customer's agent already knows there's a cold front coming, already checked pantry inventory, and is already querying soup options from multiple brands simultaneously?

Campbell's has a seventy-year head start on data-driven marketing. But the agent doesn't care about that history. It cares about structured data, real-time availability, and competitive pricing—right now.

## What the Stories Teach Us

Every story in this piece illustrates the same truth: **data advantage is temporary, but data thinking is permanent.**

Mike Cunningham's $5 chip would have been revolutionary in 2015. Today it's solving yesterday's problem. Casey's 300% conversion lift was brilliant for human customers—and invisible to agents. Georgia-Pacific moved from data scarcity to data abundance, now faces structural invisibility. Delta's Porsche on the tarmac showed what unified data feels like. Apex did everything right for one paradigm and got blindsided by the next. Heineken's bullseye got inverted. Joe's fragmented journey got unified, then collapsed entirely. Father Schmitt's 1961 system embodied principles that outlasted every technology that implemented them. Campbell's seventy years of weather-based targeting may matter less than their API response time.

The marketers who will thrive in the next decade aren't the ones with the best technology. They're the ones who understand why the technology matters—and can see around the corner to what comes next.

Three books. One lesson: **the story always wins.**
